# A More Powerful Evaluation Toolbox for Salient Object Detection

More details can be found at the origin repository:  https://github.com/ArcherFMY/sal_eval_toolbox

This forked repository mainly adds the following new features:
* More metrics: E-measure and weighted F-measure.
* Support for drawing according to existing mat files.
* Support custom threshold to binarize masks. Because the masks of some datasets are not exactly a binary map.
